Requirements
============

You need to install a driver library, that supports the CTAPI interface for
this extension to link against. The newest version of the towitoko library,
that is required to drive the Towitoko Chipdrive Micro, Extern, Extern II,
Intern, Twin, and the "Kartenzwerg", can be download at this URL:

Installation
============

Install the gem with

# CTAPI_LIBRARY=LIBRARYNAME gem install ctapi

and the extension should be built and installed.

Alternatively you can just type into the command line as root:

# CTAPI_LIBRARY=LIBRARYNAME ruby install.rb

where LIBRARYNAME is the name of the ctapi driver library to use. If you want
to link against the towitoko library, this would be, e. g.,

# CTAPI_LIBRARY=LIBRARYNAME ruby install.rb

towitoko is also the default choice for the library.

Documentation
=============

To generate the documentation in doc/ type:
$ ruby make_doc.rb

Also look into the cardinfo.rb and ctsh.rb executables if you want to see how
to use this library.
